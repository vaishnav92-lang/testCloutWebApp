> Talk to me about it.

✦ Of course. The error you're seeing, PrismaClient is unable to run in this browser environment, happens because of a fundamental security and design
   principle in modern web applications.

  The Problem: Server Code vs. Browser Code

   * Server-Side Code: Your database and tools like Prisma are designed to run securely on a server. The server has protected access to the database.
   * Client-Side Code: Your React components (like the JobReferralPage) run in the user's web browser. For security reasons, the browser is a
     restricted environment and is not allowed to connect directly to your database.

  The issue is that the reconstructChain function uses Prisma to talk to the database, but it was being called from inside your JobReferralPage
  component, which runs in the browser. You can't put server-only code in a file that's imported and used by a client component.

  The Solution: Creating an API Route

  The standard way to solve this is to create a middleman—an API route that runs on the server.

   1. Create an API Endpoint: I'll create a new file at src/app/api/referrals/reconstruct-chain/route.ts. This file will define a server-side endpoint
       that the browser can safely call.
   2. Move the Logic: This new endpoint will be responsible for calling the reconstructChain function. Since the API route runs on the server, it can
      safely use Prisma to query the database.
   3. Update the Frontend: I will then modify the JobReferralPage component. Instead of calling reconstructChain directly, it will make a network
      fetch request to our new /api/referrals/reconstruct-chain URL, sending the jobId and userId. The API will then return the result, which the
      component can use to update its state.

  This separates the client-side presentation logic from the server-side data logic, which fixes the error and follows best practices for building
  secure and robust Next.js applications.

  Shall I proceed with creating that API route?

> Doesn't it still work?

✦ That's a great question. The application might appear to partially work, but the core functionality is broken, and it's producing incorrect
  results.

  Here's what's happening:

   1. When the JobReferralPage loads, it tries to call the reconstructChain function.
   2. That function immediately fails with the Prisma error you saw because it's running in the browser.
   3. The code you have in src/app/jobs/[id]/refer/page.tsx is written to handle errors. It has a try...catch block.
   4. When the error is "caught," it logs the error to the console and sets the currentChainLength to a default value of 0.

  So, while the page doesn't crash, it's operating on incorrect data. The PotentialEarningsPreview component, for example, will show the user a
  potential payout as if they are the first person in the referral chain, even if they are not.

  In short, it doesn't work correctly. The feature is failing silently from a UI perspective, but the logic is not executing, and the information
  presented to the user is wrong. The only way to fix it is to move the database-dependent code to a server-side API route.
